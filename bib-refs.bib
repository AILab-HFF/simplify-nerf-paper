	abstract = {A growing number of psychometric scales have been developed to measure a plethora of constructs within the umbrella term, User Experience ({UX}). Unfortunately, selecting an appropriate scale for {UX} can be difficult for the usability practitioner. Based on psychometric scale development literature, the Scale Adoption Framework for Evaluation ({SAFE}) has been designed to support practitioners in selecting appropriate scales. The {SAFE} is presented in this paper, with an example of how it could be used. However, utilizing the {SAFE} has emphasised the difficulty in selecting suitable measures, revealing that the {SAFE} will not solve this issue in isolation. Two main challenges are presented for the {VUUM} workshop: more explicit and transparent descriptions of psychometric scale development, and a need for more sensitive psychometric scales. Future work should build on these challenges by consulting usability practitioners directly. Author Keywords Psychometric scale development, evaluation, {UCD}.},

Hier treffen sich Personen aus Wissenschaft und Praxis, um neueste Forschungsergebnisse zu diskutieren, Erfahrungen auszutauschen und neue Produkte und Methoden kennen zu lernen. Die Tagung bietet Einblicke in Entwicklungen in den Bereichen Usability, User Experience, Mensch-Computer-Interaktion, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work und Gestaltung interaktiver Medien. Spielend einfach interagieren - das Motto der Mensch und Computer 2017 deutet in unterschiedliche Richtungen: Einerseits verweist es auf die unbestreitbar gewachsene Bedeutung der Computerspielindustrie, deren ökonomisches Gewicht das der Filmindustrie bereits vor einigen Jahren übertroffen hat. Computerspiele sind auch zu einem wichtigen Gegenstand der Interaktionsforschung geworden. Zugleich sind spielerische Elemente aufgegriffen worden, um in ganz unterschiedlichen Situationen die Mensch-Maschine-Interaktion anzureichern. Sei es, dass im Arbeitskontext durch Gamification (Spielifizierung) Anreize für den Umgang mit beruflich genutzter Software gesetzt werden sollen, sei es, dass durch Spaß und Freude an der Interaktion joy of use entstehen soll. Natürlich ist der Bezug auf das Spielerische wie immer nicht der ausschließliche inhaltliche Fokus der Tagung. Auch in diesem Jahr zeigen die Beiträge das breite Themenfeld und die vielfältigen Anwendungen im Umfeld der Mensch-Maschine-Interaktion. Der Tagungsband enthält die Lang- und Kurzbeiträge des wissenschaftlichen Fachprogramms, das auf der Mensch und Computer präsentiert wird.},

Halodoc is one of the companies that use the internet to provide health services for its users. Halodoc has services such as features for consultation with doctors, online medicine purchases, and hospital appointments. Halodoc’s vision is to simplifying healthcare, but there are still many complaints and negative reviews about Halodoc on Google play store and Apple store about the usability. This paper uses a mixed-method approach using User Experience Questionnaire ({UEQ}) and Usability Testing. The results of the analysis were used as a reference for making the improvement designs. The results of the {UEQ} evaluation showed accordingly to the {UEQ} benchmark already a good level of {UX}. However, the usability test uncovered some concrete areas for improvement.},
