% Technology Stack Rational
% Architecture Diagram & data flow

The architecture followed a standard client server pattern, with the server functioning as a wrapper for the nerfstudio CLI, and the client as a web application.
The server was built using tRPC, a framework for building type-safe APIs in TypeScript.
It was responsible for handling incoming requests from the client, and translating them into commands that the nerfstudio CLI could understand.
Requests from the client were sent to the server using HTTP requests, and in case of an asynchronous operation, the server would update the client on using websockets.

For the prototype, all the components were composed into a single docker container and deployed as a single unit.
This leveraged the pre-configured container provided by nerfstudio, and allowed for a quick and easy deployment of the prototype.

\section{Frontend Development} 
\label{sec:system:frontend}

% Setup, configuration, and component architecture
% UI/UX design principles

The frontend was built with React, as it is a popular and well supported framework for building web applications.
Vite was used as a build tool, as it provides a fast and efficient development experience.
To accelerate the styling process, Tailwind CSS was used, it is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined classes that can be used to style components.
In additional the daisyUI component library provided a set of pre-styled components that could be used to quickly build the UI.

Extensibility was a key considerations during the development of the frontend, ...

\section{Backend Development}
\label{sec:system:backend}

% Advantages of tRPC, configuration, and API design

The backend was built using tRPC, a framework for building type-safe APIs in TypeScript.
This type-safety was useful in building the API, as nerfstudio endpoints require a specific set of parameters of various types, that could be easily defined using TypeScript and reused in the frontend.

With tRPC,
